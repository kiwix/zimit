Technical background
--------------------

This version of Zimit runs a single-site headless-Chrome based crawl in a Docker container and produces a ZIM of the crawled content.

The system uses:
 - `oldwebtoday/chrome` - to install a recent version of Chrome 84
 - `puppeteer-cluster` - for running Chrome browsers in parallel
 - `pywb` - in recording mode for capturing the content
 - `warc2zim` - to convert the crawled WARC files into a ZIM

The driver in `index.js` crawls a given URL using puppeteer-cluster.

After the crawl is done, warc2zim is used to write a zim to the
`/output` directory, which can be mounted as a volume.

Usage
-----

`zimit` is intended to be run in Docker.

To build locally run:

```bash
docker build -t openzim/zimit .
```

The image accepts the following parameters:

- `URL` - the url to be crawled (required)
- `--workers N` - number of crawl workers to be run in parallel
- `--wait-until` - Puppeteer setting for how long to wait for page load. See [page.goto waitUntil options](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/api.md#pagegotourl-options). The default is `load`, but for static sites, `--wait-until domcontentloaded` may be used to speed up the crawl (to avoid waiting for ads to load for example).
- `--name` - Name of ZIM file (defaults to the hostname of the URL)
- `--output` - output directory (defaults to `/output`)
- `--limit U` - Limit capture to at most U URLs
- `--exclude <regex>` - skip URLs that match the regex from crawling. Can be specified multiple times.

The following is an example usage. The `--cap-add` and `--shm-size`
flags are needed to run Chrome in Docker.

Example command:

```bash
docker run  -v /output:/output --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
       --shm-size=1gb openzim/zimit URL --name myzimfile --workers 2 --wait-until domcontentloaded
```

The puppeteer-cluster provides monitoring output which is enabled by
default and prints the crawl status to the Docker log.

Nota bene
---------

A first version of a generic HTTP scraper was created in 2016 during
the [Wikimania Esino Lario
Hackathon](https://wikimania2016.wikimedia.org/wiki/Programme/Kiwix-dedicated_Hackathon).

That version is now considered outdated and [archived in `2016`
branch](https://github.com/openzim/zimit/tree/2016).
